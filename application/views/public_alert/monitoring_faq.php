                    <li><strong>Refresh the form.</strong> - This is to purge any remnants from the previous release that might have remained unintentionally due to the user's site navigation activities (i.e. clicking "BACK" on browser retains input of the previous release).</li>
                    <li><strong>Check the data timestamp.</strong> - Is it 30 minutes before the intended release? If instantaneous, is it rounded to the nearest 30 minutes? Did I used the time when the data is validated? Is it in 24-hour format?</li>
                    <li><strong>Check the release timestamp.</strong> - Does it correspond to my data timestamp? (e.g. A 16:00 release time for a 15:30 data timestamp, not 04:00 release time) Is it in 24-hour format?</li>
                    <li><strong>Check accordingly the operational triggers.</strong> - <strong>DO I HAVE ANY NEW TRIGGERS?</strong> If <strong>YES</strong>, note the timestamp and include it on the release along with its basic information detail. If there is <strong>NO DATA</strong>, check accordingly the necessary checkbox (see <strong>OPERATION CONCERNS</strong> below). If there is <strong>NO NEW TRIGGERS</strong>, no additional information needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check the internal alert level.</strong> - Is the internal alert level dubious? Does it correspond to our intended release? Does my A1 public alert level has s/S or g/G triggers included? (There should be no g or s triggers on an A1 release!)</li>

                        <p>All of the given are operational triggers we are using that are also represented on the internal alert level. Their purpose is to easily identify the triggers involved for an event monitoring. All of them indicates “No Data” but for different triggers and functions.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>ND</strong> – <strong>used for alerts A0 and A1</strong> to indicate <strong>lack of data for BOTH ground and sensor</strong>; important for events with A1 alerts since we cannot lower an event to A0 at end of its validity if no ground OR sensor data is available to prove no significant movement happened on the site, hence an extension of four hours will be added to its validity.</li>
                            <li><strong>R0</strong> – signifies <strong>no data for rainfall</strong> (read as R-null); note that <strong>it is different from lower-case r-zero (r0)</strong> that denotes presence of rainfall data below threshold level</li>
                            <li><strong>g0</strong> – stands for <strong>no ground data</strong> (regardless if alert is A2 or A3); purpose similar to ND (i.e. extension of validity)</li>
                            <li><strong>s0</strong> – represents <strong>no sensor data</strong> (regardless if alert is A2 or A3); purpose similar to ND (i.e. extension of validity)</li>

                        <p>Exclusive-lowering protocol means that to lower an alert on a specific site, <strong>the operational trigger/s that occurred within the event monitoring must provide substantial evidence to conclude the said monitoring</strong>. This applies to ground (g/G) and sensor triggers (s/S).</p>

                        <p><strong>Sites with A1 alerts MUST also provide either ground OR sensor data</strong> indicating no significant ground movement in order to lower the alert to A0.</p>

                        <p><strong><i>Sites without data for their specific operational triggers at the end of their monitoring period would warrant an extension of four (4) hours on the validity of the monitoring.</i></strong></p>

                        <p>Example: An A2 alert was raised on a site due to ground measurement data (L2/g). To lower the site’s alert to A0, a ground data must show no significant movement at the end of its validity. Failure to do so would mean extension of the validity by four (4) hours.</p>

The tracker number is shown on the PDF bulletin we send every regular release. For whatever reason, releasing another EWI for a same timestamp would add 1 to the current bulletin tracker number, hence, a flaw on data continuity and consistency. For the sake of data integrity and consistency, we prohibit the deletion of releases and advocate <strong>responsible EWI release</strong>.</p>

                        <p>For instantenous releases and ground measurement triggers, use the timestamp when you verified the trigger is valid, rounded to the nearest 30 minutes, or when the monitoring scripts had run the needed calculations and the result appeared valid on the PublicAlert.json.</p>

                        <p>For the regular four-hour event-monitoring releases and routine releases, use the data timestamps 30 minutes before the actual release.</p>

                        <p>Rationale: Rounding off the data and trigger timestamps to the nearest 30 minutes would provide consistency on our data since the outputs produced by the monitoring scripts run on every 15- and 45-minute of an hour and released on the 0 and 30-minute of an hour.</p>
